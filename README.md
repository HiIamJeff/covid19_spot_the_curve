# COVID19_Spot_the_Curve
#### Last update time: 2020/05/05 (Added a web app)
An interactive and up-to-date web app for visualizing the "Curve" of each country has come online (Made with Plolty and Dash; Host with Heroku).
- https://spot-the-curve-coronavirus.herokuapp.com/ (It takes a few seconds to load the first time.)

This is a visualization and quick analysis project about Coronavirus COVID-19. I used the confirmed cases data to visualize and investigate the current "Curve" through basic data science approach. This repo focuses on only the ETL (Data cleaning) and visualization.

### Data in Used

### Acknowledge
Please keep in mind that the source data are still undergoing rapid developing. I will keep updating the notebook as much as I could. I am a data science practitioner and have little knowledge in Epidemiology. This is an attempt to apply analysis skill to translate the data into understandable information (Report and EDA). If I made any inaccurate information or you have any thoughts on the article, please let me know! Thanks!
